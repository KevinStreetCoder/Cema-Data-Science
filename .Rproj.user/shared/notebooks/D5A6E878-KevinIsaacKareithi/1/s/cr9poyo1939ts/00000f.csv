Please refer to R-spatial evolution reports for details, especially

It may be desirable to make the sf package available;
package maintainers should consider adding sf to Suggests:.

######################### Warning from 'xts' package ##########################
#                                                                             #
# The dplyr lag() function breaks how base R's lag() function is supposed to  #
# work, which breaks lag(my_xts). Calls to lag(my_xts) that you type or       #
# source() into this session won't work correctly.                            #
#                                                                             #
# Use stats::lag() to make sure you're not using dplyr::lag(), or you can add #
# conflictRules('dplyr', exclude = 'lag') to your .Rprofile to stop           #
# dplyr from breaking base R's lag() function.                                #
#                                                                             #
# Code in packages is not affected. It's protected by R's namespace mechanism #
# Set `options(xts.warn_dplyr_breaks_lag = FALSE)` to suppress this warning.  #
